It turns out in m3u format the #EXT info line is VITAL to the playlist working.
It contains critical metadata including runtime! title and artist.

I'll add those lines as well and things should work :)

Things worked.  It required a bit more editing on the windows side to get the paths correct.  I also noticed that I am missing some music on thhis computer.

I got the thing doing what I wanted it to. It converts the path and everything but the files CANT BE RUN IN VLC.

There's more info in the logs but I haven't found them.
